Project Context: I am building a web-based psychology puzzle game called "Mind Maze" with a "Mysterious/Noir" aesthetic. The frontend is built with React and expects a specific JSON structure to render quiz questions.

The App Flow:

Standard Mode: Loads static questions from a file.

Tailored Mode: The user inputs a theme (e.g., "Finance") or context. This input is sent to my backend. The backend must use an LLM to generate unique, themed psychology puzzles based on that context.

The Current Task: I have an existing Python script that connects to my LLM. I need you to modify this script so it takes a user's "Context/Theme" string as input and outputs a valid JSON object that strictly matches my frontend's schema.

Requirements for the Script:

Input: Accept a text string (the user's theme).

Prompt Engineering: Update the system prompt sent to the LLM. It must instruct the LLM to act as a "Psychological Profiler" and generate 3-5 riddles/puzzles based on the provided theme.

Output Schema: The LLM must return JSON data that includes:

questionText: The riddle or scenario.

type: Either "multiple_choice" or "hybrid" (boolean + number).

options: (If multiple choice) An array of strings [A, B, C, D].

correctAnswer: The correct option or value.

biasId: The name of the bias being tested (e.g., "Sunk Cost Fallacy").

explanation: A short text explaining why this is a bias.

Integration: Ensure the script parses the LLM's response and saves it as a tailoredQuiz.json file (or returns it as an API response) that my React frontend can consume immediately.

Please look at my current script and propose the necessary changes to implement this generation flow.
